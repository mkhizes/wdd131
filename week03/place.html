The province has three international borders: Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and Mozambique to the north and Lesotho to the west. There are also three provincial borders: Mpumalanga to the northwest, Free State to the west, and Eastern Cape to the south.

        The Drakensberg, or uKhahlamba, mountain range is on the western border of KwaZulu-Natal. This range has the highest peaks in South Africa, including several that exceed 9,800 feet (3,000 meters). The Lebombo Mountains are in the far north of KwaZulu-Natal. There are large plains in the middle of the province. The lowland region on the Indian Ocean coast is subtropical. Forests grow along the coast at Dukuduku and Kosi Bay.

        The Tugela (or Thukela) is the largest of KwaZulu-Natal’s many rivers. The Tugela Waterfall on this river is the second highest waterfall on Earth. In five stages it drops a total of 3,110 feet (948 meters). It is situated within Royal Natal National Park. Another notable waterfall in KwaZulu-Natal is Howick Falls, on the Umgeni (or Mngeni) River. The iSimangaliso Wetland Park (formerly Saint Lucia Wetland Park), located on the coast, is South Africa’s largest protected wetland and was the first UNESCO World Heritage site in South Africa.
        
        People and Culture
        KwaZulu-Natal is one of South Africa’s most populous provinces. More than 85 percent of its people are black Africans. The great majority of the black Africans are of Zulu ethnicity and speak the Zulu language. A “cultural village” called Shakaland, in Eshowe, offers visitors a look at Zulu culture and history.
        
        KwaZulu-Natal has more people of Asian descent than any other South African province. Even so, they form less than one-twelfth of the provincial population. Most of the Asians are Indian and practice the Hindu religion, but some are Muslims. Less than five percent of the people are white. Most of the whites are descendants of British and German settlers and of Boers (Dutch settlers).

        Durban is the largest city in KwaZulu-Natal. Ulundi was the administrative capital of KwaZulu until 2004 and at other times in the past. In 2004 Pietermaritzburg became the province’s capital. Other important towns are Richards Bay, Dundee, uMnambithi (formerly Ladysmith), Newcastle, Port Shepstone, Estcourt, and Vryheid.

        KwaZulu’s most important crop is sugarcane, which grows on plantations on the coast. A warm climate makes the coastal area suitable for growing subtropical fruits such as bananas, guavas, and mangoes. In the interior there are vegetable, dairy, and livestock farms. Another major source of income is forestry, especially in the areas around Vryheid, Eshowe, Richmond, Harding, and Ngome. These places are also known for their tea plantations.
        
        Mining and mineral processing are important in the province’s economy. Coal is mined in the north, around Newcastle and Dundee. Richards Bay is the center of South Africa’s aluminum industry. The Richards Bay Minerals company processes iron and titanium ore.
        
        Durban has the busiest port in South Africa, and one of the largest ports in the world. The port of Richards Bay, north of Durban, was the world’s leading coal exporter in the early 21st century. Together, Durban and Richards Bay handle most of South Africa’s shipping.
        
        Durban and nearby Pinetown form KwaZulu-Natal’s economic and industrial center. Factories there concentrate on textiles and clothing, food processing, chemicals, sugar production, and oil processing. Motor vehicles and related products are also manufactured there. Other industrial centers are located in Pietermaritzburg, uMnambithi, Hammarsdale, Richmond, and Mandeni.
