    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <h3>To assist,uplift and unite Businesses while doing the same for the community</h3>
    <p>Because of high unemployment rate in my country, particularly 
      in my city Durban where most people flock in numbers to look for work. 
      I chose this subject with the intention of uniting the business sector, 
      and uplifting upcoming small businesses so that they can be in touch with 
      the communities that are benefiting from their services hence this will 
      increase trust and lessen crime as others will be hired when job opportunities
      increase. These businesses can also sponsor skills learning programs such as 
      bricklaying, tiling, electrical installation, plumbing, etc. In this way, we 
      will curb poverty and crime at the same time. Even awareness campaigns will be 
      supported  by these businesses.</p>
    

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience is the Small Micro Medium Enterprises, even Commercial business people who operating under Ethekwini
      Metropolitan Municipality and surrounding. I am targeting the community as this organisation has a database of
      their service providers, that they may be aware of what these businesses do for the community other than offering
      them services.</p>
